# Plan: MCP Tool UX Review via Simulated Agent Workflows

## Context
The MCP server exposes 54 tools across 10 domains. Tool names, descriptions, and the top-level `INSTRUCTIONS` constant are the only guidance an AI agent gets when deciding which tools to call and in what order. Poor naming, vague descriptions, or missing cross-references lead to wasted tool calls, wrong parameters, or broken multi-step workflows. This review simulates realistic agent sessions to surface those issues.

## Approach

Launch **6 parallel "tester" agents**, each playing the role of an AI agent trying to accomplish a specific end-to-end workflow. Each agent receives:
- The full list of tool names and descriptions (as an agent would see them)
- The `INSTRUCTIONS` constant
- A realistic user prompt

Each agent evaluates:
1. **Discoverability** — Could it find the right tool(s) by name/description alone?
2. **Description clarity** — Were parameters, formats, and constraints clear?
3. **Cross-tool guidance** — For multi-step flows, did descriptions/instructions explain the sequence?
4. **Naming consistency** — Any confusing overlaps, inconsistencies, or misleading names?
5. **Missing tools or gaps** — Anything the agent needed but couldn't find?

### The 6 Workflows

| # | Workflow | User prompt (simulated) | Key tools expected |
|---|----------|------------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Weekly expense entry** | "I bought coffee at Starbucks for €4.50, groceries at Lidl for €67.20, and a book on Amazon for €12.99. Enter these." | create_transaction or create_transactions, list_categories |
| 2 | **Recurring bill setup** | "I pay €49.99/month for Netflix on the 15th, and €9.99/week for a meal plan every Monday. Set these up as recurring." | create_recurring, list_recurring, list_categories, generate_pending_recurring |
| 3 | **Monthly budget check** | "How am I doing on my budgets this month? Am I overspending anywhere?" | get_budget_status, get_category_stats, get_spending_summary, get_trends |
| 4 | **Investment portfolio management** | "I just bought 5 shares of VWCE at €112.50 each. Also, how's my portfolio doing overall?" | search_symbol, buy_asset, get_portfolio, get_asset_performance, get_allocation |
| 5 | **Foreign currency travel expenses** | "I was in the US last week and spent $45.00 on dinner and $120.00 on a hotel. Enter these as EUR." | convert_currency, create_transaction or create_transactions, list_categories |
| 6 | **Category cleanup & reorganization** | "I have duplicate categories 'Food' and 'Groceries'. Merge them, then recategorize all transactions from merchant 'Lidl' into the merged category." | list_categories, merge_categories, recategorize |

### Bonus evaluations (each agent also checks)
- Is the `query` escape hatch well-signposted for edge cases?
- Are `get_` vs `list_` naming conventions consistent and intuitive?

## Execution

1. Launch agents **sequentially** (one at a time), since they share a live database and concurrent mutations could interfere
2. Each agent **uses the live Pinch MCP tools** — they're installed and available. No need to read source files.
3. Each agent walks through the workflow step by step, noting friction, confusion, or gaps as they go
4. Each agent cleans up any test data it created (delete transactions, assets, etc.) before finishing
5. Each agent returns structured notes: discoverability issues, description problems, missing guidance, suggestions
6. After all 6 complete, compile all feedback into `mcp_review.md` at the project root

## Output: `mcp_review.md`

## Verification
- Review `mcp_review.md` for actionable, specific feedback
- Each issue should reference the exact tool name and quote the problematic description
