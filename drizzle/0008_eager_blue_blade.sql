-- Multi-currency: each transaction now stores its native currency plus a
-- denormalized base-currency amount, so report aggregations are O(N) sums
-- with no FX joins. Pinch instances are base-currency-immutable per DB.
--
-- Backfill assumption: existing rows are EUR-only. The currency column is
-- backfilled from the configured base_currency setting (falling back to
-- 'EUR' for old databases that haven't gone through onboarding yet) and
-- amount_base is set equal to amount, on the assumption that historic data
-- was already in the configured base currency. Users who logged non-base-
-- currency cash flows against multi-currency assets pre-migration should
-- review and correct those rows manually.
